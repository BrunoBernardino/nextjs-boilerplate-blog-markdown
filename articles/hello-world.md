It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful? '! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! Annihilate? No. No violence. __I won't stand for it.__ *Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!* I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

1. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. `Simple`. What could possibly go wrong?
2. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.
3. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

This is nice!
